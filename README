# Cloudwalk Technical Challenge

## Solutions

This repo contains 2 solutions for the proposed challege:

1. **Script format**: This one is a simple script for parsing the log data. Something I'll be creating when *"I just need to process this log to find a bug"*
1. **Oriented Object Approach**: This one structures the log data into objects, more suitable for use the log data into a broader application

## Running the code

The code were created for ruby 3.2. They can be run by calling the following files from the project root:

```
$ script/parse.rb
$ oop/parser.rb
```
